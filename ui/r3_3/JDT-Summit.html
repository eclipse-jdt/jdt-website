<h4><img src="../images/ok.gif" alt="Done" border="0" height="10" width="10"> Java SE 6<span class="Notes"> (Wednesday morning / started Tuesday afternoon)</span></h4>

<ul>
<li>What will be the new Java 6 features and what support do we have to add for 3.3.</li>
<li>Debug features to expose:
  <ul>
    <li>Heap walking<br>
      <span class="Notes">
      According to Darin, McQ says we should do what makes sense.<br>
      &rArr; Debug should expose the set of things that
      all Java programmers will want. For example, we could start with a feature to "show references" to an object
      in the variables view, or an action to "get all instances" of a type. This would be in place of a full blown "heap walking"
      perspective.</span>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>force early return, monitor access/release<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Script integration in Java 6 (JSR 223): Should we start looking into tooling support for JavaScript?<br>
    <span class="Notes">&rArr; currently not part of the JDT scope. No action for 3.3.</span><br>
</li>
</ul>


<h4><img src="../images/ok.gif" alt="Done" border="0" height="10" width="10"> Java SE 7<span class="Notes"> (Wednesday morning)</span><br>
</h4>
What will be the new Java 7 features and what support do we have to
add for 3.3.<br>
<span class="Notes">&rArr; This will contain many big changes/additions (e.g. XML inside Java code) which is out of scope for 3.3.</span><br>



<h4><img src="../images/ok.gif" alt="Done" border="0" height="10" width="10"> Code Assist<span class="Notes"> (Tuesday morning)</span><br>
</h4>
<ul>
	<li>improve code assist when import missing (JDT Core: <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=44984">bug 44984</a> JDT Text: <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=107496">bug 107496</a>)<br>
    <span class="Notes">Might be doable for local variables and eventually casts but most likely not for fields.<br>
&rArr;
JDT Core will investigate and try to provide a solution.</span><br>
</li>
	<li style="text-decoration: line-through;">code assist inserting code templates, e.g. (<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=97912">bug 97912</a>)</li>
	<li>provide better support to add a cast (<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=54980">bug 54980</a>)<br>
    <span class="Notes">
    Should not go into code assist but into quick assist. Triggers could be: "(x" and "(x.".<br>
    &rArr; Up to JDT UI whether to tackle this item for 3.3.<br>
    &rArr; JDT Text will experiment with a quick assist/fix content assist proposal computer (<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=151061">bug 151061</a>)
    </span>
</li>
	<li>code assist for declarations that are already used later in the code (<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=150228">bug 150228</a>):
	<pre>	int f&lt;code assist&gt;<br>	System.out.print(foo);<br></pre><span class="Notes">&rArr; JDT Core will investigate and try to provide the unresolved local variables.
    Idea: JDT Text could investigate to provide a proposal computer that wraps quick assist</span>

    </li>
    <li>provide code assist context: AST or other way
    	<ul>
    	 <li>need to know what fields, methods, variables are currently defined (use case: getter/setter proposals)</li>
    	 <li>need the current statements (use case: annotation codeassist, method argumnet code assist)</li>
    	</ul><span class="Notes">&rArr;
JDT UI and JDT Core will work together and check whether a Java element
or a diet AST would help to resolve the problem.
Discussed approaches:<ul><li>Provide IJavaElements with updated source positions (problem: Will have to use a special working copy owner)</li>
<li>Provide a sparse AST DOM (only declarations, no statements)</li>
<li>Provide a statement recovered AST DOM with nodes for the current method (to be evaluated if statement recovery can really help here)</li>
<li>Provide a custom AST DOM (new AST level) with extra recovered nodes</li>
</ul>
If not JDT UI could fix the getter/setter bug by waiting for the shared AST. 
(Original bug is <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=110181">bug 110181</a>) </span><br>
</li>  
</ul>


<h4><img src="../images/ok.gif" alt="Done" border="0" height="10" width="10"> JavaBean Support<span class="Notes"> (Monday morning)</span><br>
</h4>
There are several feature requests asking for better support for JavaBean Property handlig, e.g. enhanced
code assist, templates, Outline grouping and a JavaBean wizard.
<br>
We should discuss and decide whether we want to do something in that area for 3.3.<br>
<br>
<span class="Notes">
			&rArr; based on the experience JDT Text &amp; UI will get from the competitive analyses, JDT Text &amp; UI will investigate minimal support limited to 3 days. No action for JDT Core at this point.</span><br>



<h4>Compiler<br>
</h4>
<ul>

	<li>general problem: how to specify the ignore list to work with false positives (Java Annotations, Javadoc tag, comment tags)<br>
    <span class="Notes">General agreement that this is
useful. First idea to flag it inside the code with @SuppressWarnings
block comments was rejected because it would pollute the code, be hard
for JDT Core and be a JDT solution only.</span><br>
    <span class="Notes">&rArr;
JDT UI will investigate into support for a shared "annotation" support for models.</span><br>

	</li><li>more advanced warnings: 
	    <ul>
    	 <li>NotNull, Nullable</li>
    	 <li>overriding methods that do not call super</li>
    	 <li>API rules: Do not instantiate, implement</li>    	 
    	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>tune the existing checks to avoid false positives: Not null, thrown exception, unused parameter</li> 
	
</ul>


<h4><img src="../images/ok.gif" alt="Done" border="0" height="10" width="10"> AST<span class="Notes"> (Monday morning)</span><br>
</h4>
<ul>
	<li><a name="AST1"/>Need a more flexible way to create multiple ASTs
	    <ul>
    	 <li>General problem: We don't know all CU when starting the AST queue</li>
    	 <li>Performance
problem: How many ASTs can we build before we run OOM. Would be nice if
core has a mechanism to manage the referenced bindings</li>
     	</ul>
  <span class="Notes">&rArr; JDT Core will look at this. Idea is to provide a binding environment object that can be reused when creating an AST.
JDT Core will hide the recreation of the compiler bindings in case of memory problems or when a AST is requested for a
already known binding. <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=150657">bug 150657</a> (Targeted for 3.3 M4)
</span>
    </li>	

	
  <li>AST sharing problem still not solved. The solution we implemented in 3.2
was that Java element listeners observe the delta to get the AST.
  <ul>
    <li>&nbsp;Problem: The caller of 'reconcile' defines if an
AST is generated and what kind (AST level, bindings, recovery) is is.
50% of callers don't care for an AST, and so the delta also doesn't
contain one.</li>
    <li>Suggestion: The working copy owner (Java
editor in the primary case) should decide if and what kind of ASTs are
provided in the Java element delta after a reconcile.</li>
  </ul>
  <span class="Notes">&rArr;
JDT Core will change the code so that the primary working copy owner
can specify the default AST level (or none) and reconcile(...) without
parameters will provide the AST with the default level and also send
out the delta with that AST. Open questions: what happens when a client specifies the AST level?
<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=124662">(bug 124662)</a> (Targeted for 3.3 M4)
 </span>

</li>
</ul>

    
<ul>

	<li>Compilation participation still not solved
	    <ul>
    	 <li>Need AST on build if a code audits or APT wants to do anything reasonable</li>
    	 <li>For performance reasons we need a way of sharing these ASTs</li>
     	 <li>For
performance reasons we need to force a certain AST kind (level,
bindings, recovery). Clients can use it or leave it. Creating multiple
AST kinds is not possible</li>
    	</ul><span class="Notes">&rArr;
JDT Core will might look into this if requested though performance consequences may prove impossible.</span>
    </li>	
	
	<li>find and create bindings in existing binding environments
	    <ul>
    	 <li>type binding with higher dimension (<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=148224">bug 148224</a>) (Targeted for 3.3 M4)</li>
    	 <li>find type binding by name or key</li> <span class="Notes">&rArr; JDT UI should just enter a bug (<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=156871">bug 156871</a>)</span>
    	 <li>create or compose type binding in binding environment of AST (<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=40096">bug 40096</a>)</li>
    	</ul>
  <span class="Notes">&rArr; Can be tackled together with <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=150657">bug 150657</a> (<a href="#AST1">see AST first item</a>)</span>    	
    	
	</li>
	<li>offer bindings also when some information is missing
	    <ul>
    	 <li>variable bindings when variable type is unresolved (<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=149567">bug 149567</a>)</li>
     	</ul><span class="Notes">&rArr; JDT Core will try to provide problem bindings instead of 'null'. Same problems would be reported with equal problem nodes.</span>
	</li>	
	
	 
</ul>


<h4><img src="../images/ok.gif" alt="Done" border="0" height="10" width="10"> Buildpath<span class="Notes"> (Monday afternoon, Darin)</span><br>
</h4>
<ul>
	<li>exclusion/inclusion filters also for libraries
	    <ul>
    	 <li>OSGI class loader allows hiding of types</li>
     	</ul><span class="Notes">&rArr; JDT Core might look into this (low prio)</span>
    </li>	

	
  <li>API rules: What types/methods are API
  <ul>
    <li>&nbsp;Make refactorings API aware: warn when API is modified</li>
  </ul>
  
    <span class="Notes"> Could be annotated in
source (Javadoc or Annotations) or on the build path. Could generate an
API description out of it (e.g. component.xml). Could have action to
set the access restrictions out of an API. Must consider that MANIFEST.MF and component.xml don't surface the same information.
<br>&rArr; No decision so far.
</span>

    </li>
    
    <li>Improve classpath variables
	    <ul>
    	 <li>Can be marked as deprecated (<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=138599">bug 138599</a>) (Targeted for 3.3 M3)</li>
    	 <span class="Notes">&rArr; Could be that a container initializer is able to resolve some variable, but if doing so it is deprecated then... ?</span>
     	 <li>Can be marked as non modifiable</li>
     	 	<span class="Notes">&rArr; JDT UI should enter a bug with precise requirement : (<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=138599">bug 156226</a>) (Targeted for 3.3 M3)</span>
     	 <li>Allow classpath variable to map to platform and/or environment variables</li>
     	 <span class="Notes">&rArr; Could be handled directly in debug JRE initializer ?</span>
     	</ul>
    <span class="Notes">&rArr; JDT Core will provide this.</span>
    </li>
    <li>Improve classpath containers
	    <ul>
    	 <li>Let containers define what is configurable/not configurable: Path, which attributes</li>
     	 <li>Allow containers to contain containers, variables and class folders</li>
     	</ul>
    <span class="Notes">&rArr; JDT Core will provide new API</span>
    </li>
    <li>Solve the JRE - compliance gap
	    <ul>
    	 <li>Specify compliance in classpath?</li>
    	 <li>Move JRE container to jdt.core?
    	 <span class="Notes">&rArr; Won't happen.</span>

<h4><img src="../images/ok.gif" alt="Done" border="0" height="10" width="10"> Search<span class="Notes"> (Wednesday afternoon)</span></h4>

<ul>
	<li>Optimizing type indicator decorator: Find all types for a given resource<br>
    <span class="Notes">&rArr; Martin will use new API that JDT Core will provide, see <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=150393">bug 150393</a>.</span>
    </li>
    <li>Static methods / fields index to offer organize imports with static imports<br>
    <span class="Notes">Should not be a separate index but in the current one but in a separate category<br>
    &rArr; no changes to the indexer: according to Philippe organize import can be done with the current infrastructure.<br>
    &rArr; <strike>JDT Text and JDT UI will have to add a new 'add static imports' option which does the static import if appropriate.</strike><br>
    WAIT: when we discussed this with the other JDT Text and UI members another idea came up by Dirk: we could simply provide a whitelist where the
    user could enter the static types and/or members he'd like to use.<br>
    After discussion with Philippe he says it's a good idea but the whitelist should be kept in JDT UI or Text land. JDT Core is
    willing to provide more (content assist) context information if needed. Martin created <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=152123">bug 152123</a> argueing that
    jdt.core is best suited to provide this.
    </span><br>
	
</li>
    <li>If search builds AST on search: API to get AST after search? (motivation: semantic search)<br>
    <span class="Notes">&rArr; no actions for now - see below for details.</span><br>
</li>
</ul>


<h4><img src="../images/ok.gif" alt="Done" border="0" height="10" width="10"> Semantic Search / Search Templates <span class="Notes">(Wednesday afternoon)</span></h4>

Power search would require to support more evolved search patterns. Can
we sketch usecases and ways to provide some degree of support which
could be evolved further to add more coverage ? Also what would a UI
for it look like (script-based ?)
<ul>
	<li>An advanced search to allow users to formulate complex searches on the AST like
	    <ul>
              <li>All invocations of NLS.format(...) that pass a string literal as first argument</li> 	
              <li>All invocations of NLS.format(...) that pass a constant that is not in a given properties file</li> 	
              <li>All invocations of NLS.format(...) that are possibly 'null'</li> 	
              <li>All catch blocks for CoreExpression that have an empty body</li>
              <li>All implementors of setVisible that do not call super</li>
  		</ul>
    </li>
    <li>We
believe that a snippet based approach will not give is this power:
We're looking at programmatic approches at the moment: JQuery, JScript,
functional languages</li>
    <li>Related areas: Custom code audits, generic refactorings</li>
</ul><span class="Notes">&rArr; JDT UI should finish and present the prototype so that we can provide feedback and decide how to continue.</span>

<h4><img src="../images/ok.gif" alt="Done" border="0" height="10" width="10"> Code Audit Integration <span class="Notes">(Wednesday afternoon)</span></h4>

<ul>
	<li> The goal is to standardize how and when code audits (our
own and contributed) are invoked and presented in the UI as well as to
provide core infrastructure. Some code audits can be computed 'as you
type', others require deep analysis that can't be done while building
but has to be kicked on by the user or other events. We have to discuss
where and how code audit result are presented (e.g. in the problems
view or in a new code audit view) and if we want to provide
infrastructure for the code audit preference pages.
Core infrastructure would allow code audits to share resources as the
AST. </li>
	<li>the basic code audit infrastructure needs to be at the LTK layer with JDT specific support built-on top of it.</li>
    
</ul><span class="Notes">&rArr; needs to be clarified first</span>

<h4>Improve the look and feel of JDT UI <span class="Notes">(Tuesday afternoon)</span><br>
</h4>
We should discuss where it makes sense to adopt new features provided by the Platform and where to further beautify the JDT UI.
<ul>
  <li>Use the new SWT capabilities in our views: different colors / styles in trees and tables</li>
  <li>Lightweight dialogs for refactoring (<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=92322">bug 92322</a>)</li>
</ul>

<span class="Notes">
<p>
The following are wishes from JDT Core members to JDT Text and JDT UI:
</p>
Philippe:
<ul>
  <li>allow to highlight code pieces that belong together with with vertical lines (<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=84878">bug 84878</a>)</li>
  <li>change history view, so after a refactoring it is possible to revisit the last changes (bug?)</li>
  
</ul>
Jerome:
<ul>
  <li>non-modal refactoring dialogs</li>
  <li>allow to change the refactoring output</li>
</ul>
Olivier:
<ul>
  <li>smart paste into "SELECTED" should remove the text in the string (<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=150249">bug 150249</a>)</li>
</ul>
Maxime:
<ul>
  <li>allow to turn a code selection into string(s) so it can be used as a test case string and the other way around (<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=150807">bug 150807</a>)</li>
  </li>
</ul>
</span>

<h4><img src="../images/ok.gif" alt="Done" border="0" height="10" width="10"> Launch config templates<span class="Notes"> (Tuesday afternoon)</span><br>
</h4>
Users want to define certain default values (e.g. compiler arguments) for a launch config type
	(<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=41353">bug 41353</a>).<br>
    <span class="Notes">Discussed full-fledged inheritance for individual launch config properties,
    but this was found to be too much for the UI (tristate everywhere, client-contributed tabs would be broken)
    as well as for the model (e.g. what if base template is not shared but child template is, etc.).
    <br>&rArr; Debug will implement a simple copy-based solution where new launch configs can be based
    on an existing launch config. New launch configs will not be connected to template after initial copying of attributes.
    <br>Note:</em> According to the current 3.3 draft plan this will not be a committed item.

</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Don't select a JRE in the build path wizards but a execution environment</li>
  <li>Combine compliance with EE</li>

<h4><img src="../images/ok.gif" alt="Done" border="0" height="10" width="10"> Bindings for non-visible members<span class="Notes"> (Tuesday afternoon, with Darin)</span></h4>

Compiling snippets that have a private field reference from a
superclass, do not have resolved bindings. For example, the snippet
"fName.length()" when compiled in the context of VectorTest, which
references fName from TestCase, does not have a resolved method binding
for "length()". I don't think that fName has a resolved type binding
either. Philippe thought this information was availale, but might not
be in the AST/DOM.<br>
<span class="Notes">
			&rArr; Darin to enter a bug for Olivier (should already be there)</span><br>
<br>

<h4><img src="../images/ok.gif" alt="Done" border="0" height="10" width="10"> Evaluations without Java project, or with modified build path<span class="Notes"> (Tuesday afternoon, with Darin)</span><br>
</h4>It
is possible to debug an application with a runtime classpath that does
not match a project's build path, or to debug an application that has
no associated projects in the workspace. Would it be possible to
perform evaluations by having the debugger perform name lookups, to
support evaluations that reflect the run(debug)-time?<br>
<span class="Notes">Debug can get the AST from the reconcile.</span><br>

<h4><img src="../images/ok.gif" alt="Done" border="0" height="10" width="10"> Scrapbook evaluation enhancements (<span class="Notes">Tuesday afternoon, with Darin)</span></h4>

Support for import statements (could be done by debugger), breakpoints, source display (stepping, etc),


<br>
<span class="Notes">&rArr; Darin said, Debug can use separate panes for imports, check the presence of Debug attributes so that they map on the right line</span><br>
<h4><img src="../images/ok.gif" alt="Done" border="0" height="10" width="10"> Scrapbook editing enhancements<span class="Notes"> (Tuesday afternoon, with Darin)</span></h4>
Separate code from
evaluation results for coloring/styling, support to auto insert closing
bracket/quote, quick fix (assign to local etc), red squiggles, CTRL-T
on selected type (hover type hierarchy), toggle (un)block comments,
shift left/right, format, organize imports, rename selected variable in
file. - these things should work anywhere an evaluation can be
performed - scrapbook, display view, variable details pane, expression

<h4><img src="../images/ok.gif" alt="Done" border="0" height="10" width="10"> Debugger usability issues<span class="Notes"> (Tuesday afternoon, with Darin)</span></h4>

Open discussion/suggestions for usability improvements in the Java debugger
<ul>
	<li>Changes in Variables view often not shown i.e. not highlighted - here's a simple scenario:
		<ol>
			<li>import JUnit 3.8.1</li>
			<li>open type <code>junit.samples.VectorTest</code> in the editor and set a breakpoint in the method <code>setUp()</code></li>
			<li>now start to debug <code>VectorTest</code></li>
			<li>once the breakpoint is hit press F6 and observe: the change is highlighted in the Variables view</li>
			<li>press F6 and observe: the next change is highlighted in the Variables view</li>
			<li>press F6 and observe: nothing highlighted in the Variables view</li>
			<li>in the Variables view expand <code>fFull</code> and observe: nothing highlighted</li>
		</ol>
		As a user I would expect that the node is auto-expanding and the changes highlighted.<br>
    <span class="Notes">&rArr;
Debug will add a slider to the Variables view where users can define
how deep the auto-expansion will be. Max. would mean "expand all".</span><br>

</ul>


<h4>Populating the JavaModel<br>
</h4>Recent additions, like Java type
indicator in label decoration, are changing the assumptions on
populating the Java model. Given the cache got tuned for certain usage,
we should make sure it is aligned with current story, and planned
evolutions. Clearly eager is considered bad. We should discuss
alternative queries, and or complementary API addition (a la type
hierarchy getCachedFlags() --&gt;
ICompilationUnit#getCachedFlags(IType/null to denote first type).
<span class="Notes">The type indicator has now been changed to use the search index (for 3.3 M1). Also in discussion is new API (<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=150393">bug 159393</a>)</span>

<h4><img src="../images/ok.gif" alt="Done" border="0" height="10" width="10"> Formatting DOM AST<span class="Notes"> (Monday)</span></h4>

Current formatter implementation is based on compiler internal AST. We
should discuss the benefits for providing a DOM AST solution instead.
What is the performance overhead, what are the consequences/benefits
for DOM AST users ?<br>
<span class="Notes">&rArr; JDT Core will not convert the
formatter to DOM AST since it does not give immediate benefits unless
formatter bugs get fix that benefit from it, is neither needed by JDT
Text nor JDT UI and has performance impacts. JDT Core will try to fix
the bugs in the formatter with another approach. This decision might change in the future should new requests arise.</span>
<h4><img src="../images/ok.gif" alt="Done" border="0" height="10" width="10"> Planned refactorings<span class="Notes"> (Wednesday morning)</span><br>
</h4>To anticipate API requests, it would be
good to explain the planned additions to refactorings. What typical new
operations are going to be provided, what expensive ones are becoming
critically used...<br>
<span class="Notes">According to Martin there is no
new JDT Core support needed at the moment, except for the support to reuse bindings (<a href="#AST1">see AST first item</a>).</span><br>

<h4>More flexible project layout<span class="Notes"> (Monday afternoon)</span><br>
</h4>When adopting Eclipse, some
pre-existing project layouts are hard to model in Eclipse. It feels
this process could be eased by allowing more configurability of the
Java project, such as allowing custom buildpath or settings on a per
source folder basis; multiple source attachments per library; inclusion
of external resources in workspace (as opposed to linking resources
which is not seen by external tools); relax classpath container
limitations, which currently do not allow nested containers, source
folders etc...<br>
<br>
<span class="Notes">Philippe discussed this within the PMC and they would only accept this under a different name: "more flexible classpath layout".<br>
Discussed about 2 hours without any conclusion so far. Dani's idea is
to leave everything as is but add a super java project that could
contain IJavaProjects.<br>
&rArr; no clear path yet</span><br>

<h4><img src="../images/ok.gif" alt="Done" border="0" height="10" width="10"> Improve compiler fault-tolerance<span class="Notes"> (Wednesday morning)</span></h4>
Missing types can greatly
deteriorate compiler output by producing too many secondary errors,
surface suboptimal DOM bindings, or even abort entire compilation
process when missing types are referenced from required classfiles. We
should investigate ways to improve this situation, remembering that the
APT Mirror API requires that bindings are still presented even in the
presence of missing types.<br>

<h4><img src="../images/ok.gif" alt="Done" border="0" height="10" width="10"> Batch Compiler<span class="Notes"> (Wednesday morning)</span><br>
</h4>Consider batch compiler improvements triggerred
by its raised visibility; I think we should make a conscious effort to
ease the dual use of the IDE
and the batch compiler, keeping in mind the fact that we also need to
be 'javac compatible' for the batch compiler; there are also
improvements
undergoing in the way we call it; and I'd like also to consider porting
to the batch environment part of the work done for us by the resource
layers
in Eclipse (or else replace it by something powerful - aka consider
canonizing filenames, etc., cleanup design points around files accessed
through
multiple paths, consider a portable file naming scheme, etc.)
I think APT folks will find an interest in this in that they will
likely be involved into batch building uses at one point in time. And
UI should be helpful in rounding up batch/IDE equivalences.<br>
<br>

<h4><img src="../images/ok.gif" alt="Done" border="0" height="10" width="10"> Provide a more useful class file viewer<span class="Notes"> (Discussed between Dani and Olivier only)</span><br>
</h4>

<ul>
	<li>It would be nice to have an extension point that could set
the viewer used to see .class file. We could imagine this extension
point to be used by a disassembler like JAD that provides source code
instead of class file structure.</li>
	<li>The class file disassembler
has some "advanced" modes that cannot be triggered by the actual class
file viewer. Right now I don't find the contents showed as useful since
it doesn't provide more information than the outliner. We could have a
class file viewer that could benefit from the SYSTEM and DETAILED mode
of the disassembler with code folding for some attributes (Code
Attribute, RuntimeAnnotations....). This could be quite interesting.</li>
	<li>We
could imagine a new view like the outliner that would show the .class
file contents for a compilation unit retrieving the corresponding
.class file. This would be very handy when debugging a problem in the
compiler.</li>
</ul>
See also <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=59495">bug 59495</a>.<br>
<span class="Notes">Clients can provide their own view on a Java class file via
"org.eclipse.ui.editors" extension point. There are currently no plans
to offer plugable views for the Class File editor.<br>
&rArr; JDT Text will ask legal (Adrian Cho) whether it is OK to show disassembled
contents and if yes, show the detailed result from the disassembler (<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=3537">bug 3537</a>)</span><br>
