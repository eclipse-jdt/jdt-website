<h2 align="center">Participating in Refactorings</h2>


<p>The document describes the refactoring processor/participant. Some of
the features outlined in the original proposal didn't get implemented
for 3.0. Those features are marked in <font color="#0000ff">blue</font>.</p>
<h3>Overall architecture</h3>
<p>To enable other plug-ins to participate in certain refactorings their
implementations are split into a processor/participant architecture. An
extensible refactoring has one processor and 0 .. n participants. The
major characteristics of processors and participants are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b><i>Processor</i></b>: the main actor of a refactoring. It can
	exist without any participants. A processor is almost identical to a
	current refactoring and is determined based on the element to be
	refactored.</li>
	<li><b><i>Participant</i></b>: participates in a refactoring. A
	participant can't exist without a processor and is determined based on
	the element to be refactored. A participant can participate in
	precondition checking and change creation. There is no support for
	participants to provide additional UI. A typical participant, provided
	by a JSP/Web plug-in, is a rename method participant. The participant
	updates references to the method to be renamed in JSP files. This
	includes both updating references in embedded Java code as well as
	updating references in tags (e.g. usebean tag, etc.).
	<p>Participants can only participate in changes triggered by a
	processor. There is no support to participate in changes caused by
	another participant. The processor/participant architecture will not
	support arbitrary refactoring composition. Refactoring composition
	requires that a precondition check describes its result in some kind of
	postcondition which is then used as input for precondition checking of
	the next sibling refactoring in the composite. Consider the following
	example: a composite refactoring consists of the two refactorings (a)
	create class A.java and (b) add a method to A.java. One precondition
	check of refactoring (b) is: does A.java exist? Therefore evaluating
	the preconditions of both refactorings in isolation will fail. In
	contrast precondition checking in the processor/participant
	architecture assumes that the changes performed by the processor and
	the participants are &quot;unrelated&quot; to each other and therefore
	the preconditions can be checked in isolation.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>Both processors and participants are contributed via extension
points. XML expressions (comparable to those used for contributing to a
pop-up menu) are used to describe their availability. <font
	color="#0000ff">For 3.0 only participants can be contributed via XML.
Processors are still contributed via code. We had a prototype running where
processors where contributed as well. The concerns were: performance,
since on selection change we evaluated extension points, the fact that
there can be more than one processor that handles an element (user
arbitration), and problems to pick processors when multiple elements
were selected</font>.</p>
<p>For each refactoring that is split into a processor/participant there
is a &quot;generic&quot; action. This action creates a generic
refactoring responsible to find the right processor and participants
depending on the element(s) selected. Having such a generic action
ensures that the same refactoring is triggered independent from where
the refactoring is activated. The UI for the refactoring is determined
by the processor chosen to process the element. Since processors and
participants create errors and change objects typically not known by the
refactoring framework the error and preview page must be extensible as
well. The concrete status error viewer is picked depending on the type
of status returned from precondition checking. The type of the change
objects determines the concrete preview viewer. Additionally special
content providers are needed for different change types to ensure proper
rendering the of tree presenting all changes. <font color="#0000ff">Since
processor are specific and contributed via code the actions aren't
generic either. They still refer to concrete processors. Additionally
the actions determines the user interface to use. Pluggable status and
preview viewers are implemented, however the tree showing the modified
resources is still JDT specific (no pluggable content provider; the
implementation of such a tree has very much in common with a generic
Navigator).</font></p>
<p>The picture below presents an overview of the new
processor/participant split. Classes labeled as &quot;generic&quot; are
provided by the refactoring framework. Classes labeled as
&quot;concrete&quot; are concrete implementations provided by clients. A
dashed line expresses a references between classes configurable via
extension points. Solid lines indicate a fixed reference not
configurable by client plug-ins.</p>

<p>The details of the processor/participant architecture are illustrated
by the examples below. </p>
<h3>Renaming a Java method</h3>
<p>Renaming method A#foo() into A#bar() takes place according to the
following steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>The generic rename refactoring searches in Eclipse's registry for a
	processor that is able to &quot;rename&quot; a Java method. An example
	of a processor capable to rename a Java method is:</p>
	<pre>&lt;renameProcessor
    id=&quot;org.eclipse.jdt.renameProcessor.Method&quot;
    class=&quot;org.eclipse.jdt.internal.corext.refactoring.rename.RenameMethodProcessor&quot;&gt;
    &lt;enablement&gt;
        &lt;with variable=&quot;element&quot;/&gt;
	    &lt;instanceof value=&quot;org.eclipse.jdt.core.IMethod&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/with&gt;
    &lt;/enablement&gt;
&lt;/renameProcessor&gt;</pre>
	<p>Due to its extensibility the new generic rename refactoring can only
	assume that it is renaming an element of type object. Hence a Java
	method rename processor must constrain its availability to IMethods.
	The &lt;enablement&gt; element can be used to describe a processor's
	availability depending on the state of the element to be renamed. <font
		color="#0000ff">This isn't implemented since processors aren't
	pluggable</font>.</p>
	<p>The rename action is disabled if no processor can be found.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Find all interested participants of a Java method rename. A typical
	rename Java method participant looks as follows:</p>
	<pre>&lt;renameParticipant
    class=&quot;org.example.jsp.refactoring.RenameMethodParticipant&quot;
    id=&quot;org.example.jsp.refactoring.renameMethodParticipant&quot;&gt;
    &lt;enablement&gt;
        &lt;with variable=&quot;affectedNatures&quot;&gt;
          &lt;iterate operator=&quot;or&quot;&gt;
            &lt;equals value=&quot;org.eclipse.jdt.core.jspnature&quot;/&gt;
          &lt;/iterate&gt;
        &lt;/with&gt;
        &lt;with varaible=&quot;element&quot;&gt;
          &lt;instanceof value=&quot;org.eclipse.jdt.core.IMethod&quot;/&gt;
          &lt;property name=&quot;org.eclipse.jsp.core.internal.isPrivate&quot; value=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/with&gt;
    &lt;/enablement&gt;
&lt;/renameParticipant&gt;	</pre>
	<p>Since participants are typically defined in higher level pug-ins
	care must be taken to avoid unnecessary plug-in loading. This is
	achieved by a two step approach:
	<ol>
		<li>the refactoring processor is responsible to compute a set of
		affected projects, called the project scope of the refactoring. E.g.
		when renaming a Java method these are all projects which directly or
		indirectly reference the project in which the method to be renamed is
		declared. Refactoring processors for other languages might use a
		different algorithm to compute the set of affected projects. A
		refactoring participant must handle the affectedNatures variable. In
		the example above this means the JSP rename method participant gets
		only loaded iff one of the affected projects has a JSP nature. This
		ensures that the JSP participant gets only loaded if the user does JSP
		development.</li>
		<li>Besides the project scope a refactoring participant has to handle
		the variable element to express for which objects it is applicable. In
		the example above the rename method participant in the JSP world is
		applicable to IMethods. Furthermore it requires that the method isn't
		private (since private methods can't be referenced outside its
		declaring type renaming them can't affect any JSP files).<br>
		</li>
	</ol>

	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Compute the activation status of the rename refactoring by
	considering activation status of the processor and all participants. If
	the returned status doesn't contain any fatal error, determine the UI
	depending on the state of the processor. Processors are UI independent
	hence they can't have any references to the UI. So the processor UI
	relationship must be defined somewhere else. <font color="#0000ff">In
	the current implementation this is done by the action. If we want to
	have &quot;generic&quot; actions then the user interface must be
	contributed via an extension point as well.</font></p>



	</li>
	<li>When the user presses the OK or Preview button the processor
	forwards the collected input (e.g new name, etc.) to all participants.
	Next user input checking is performed considering the rename processor
	and all loaded participants. Depending on the outcome of this check,
	the refactoring is executed by computing a composite change containing
	the changes from the processor and the participants.</li>
	<li>Picking the right error and preview viewer happens analogous to
	other viewer selection in Eclipse.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Derived Elements</h3>
<p>The concept of derived elements is discussed using the rename Java
field refactoring. Fields are commonly used as properties with
corresponding setter and getter methods. A special rename field
refactoring is aware of this relationship and renames the setter and
getter method when the field gets renamed. Participants are contributed
based on the element to be changed. Since the main element is a field no
rename method participants are loaded. Therefore a processor can provide
a set of additional elements that it manipulates. These elements are
called derived elements. In contrast to participants that work on the
main element (in our example the Java field), derived participants may
depend on user input. E.g. in JDT renaming the corresponding setter and
getter of a field can be controlled by the user. So derived participants
can only be loaded after the user has pressed the finish or preview
button. Since they missed the initial condition checking phase of the
precondition checking the result of the initial condition check of
derived participants is merged into the result of the processor's final
condition checking.</p>

<h3>Resource Modifications</h3>
<p>The concept of resource modifications is discussed using the rename
Java package refactoring. Although packages are mapped to folders on the
file system, renaming a package is a different operation than renaming
its underlying folder. Renaming a package maps to the following resource
operations:</p>
<ol>
	<li>create a folder with the new name, if such a folder doesn't exist
	yet.</li>
	<li>move all files from the underlying folder to the new folder created
	in step 1.</li>
	<li>delete the underlying folder if it is empty.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now consider the following example: package p1 contains Java and HTML
files. Additionally, there is a HTML plug-in that wants to participate
in moving HTML files to update href elements in other HTML files. Since
a HTML plug-in doesn't know anything about Java it can't participate in
renaming a package. Even if it had a reference to the Java plug-in,
participating in a package rename to determine this situation would
require that the HTML plug-in doubles the logic for mapping a package
rename to the underlying file system. To solve this problem a
refactoring processor must express higher level operations in terms of
resource modifications when possible. These resource modifications are
then taken to determine the appropriate set of participants. This means
for the HTML plug-in that it is enough to register a file move
participant. Like participants for derived elements participants for
resource modifications are computed after user input. Hence their
initial condition checking is merged into the processor's final
condition checking as well.</p>
<h3>Specializing Processors</h3>
<p>Source folders (package fragment roots) are a special kind of
folders. Besides their underlying folder on disk additional information
about the build path and the output folder is associated with a source
folder. Will there be a special rename source folder processor or a
folder rename participant? The Java model offers a method to rename a
source folder which updates the necessary build path information.
Therefore implementing source folder rename with a participant
duplicates that code in a participant. Furthermore the provided delta
looks different. A participant implementation triggers the following
deltas:</p>
<ul>
	<li>a resource delta notifying about the folder rename.</li>
	<li>a Java model delta notifying about the build path changes.</li>
	<li>a Java model delta notifying about the source folder rename without
	build path updates. This delta occurs since the Java model listens to
	resource deltas and tries to map them back to Java model deltas.</li>
</ul>
<p>A special source folder processor triggers the following deltas:</p>
<ul>
	<li>a Java model delta notifying about the source folder rename and the
	build path update.</li>
	<li>a resource delete notifying the folder rename.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly the second delta is more appropriate. It is exactly what
clients listening to deltas expect. Therefore the source folder rename
is implemented using a special processor. <font color="#0000ff">In the
current implementation this is hard wired since processors can't be
contributed. If we support contributing processors the two processors
have to be defined as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote><pre>
#### The processor to rename resource (files, folders, projects, ....)
&lt;renameProcessor
    id=&quot;org.eclipse.jdt.renameProcessor.IResource&quot;
    class=&quot;org.eclipse.jdt.internal.corext.refactoring.rename.RenameResourceProcessor&quot;&gt;
    &lt;enablement&gt;
        &lt;instanceof value=&quot;org.eclipse.core.resources.IResource&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/enablement&gt;
&lt;/renameProcessor&gt;

#### The processor to rename source folders
&lt;renameProcessor
    id=&quot;org.eclipse.jdt.renameProcessor.IPackageFragmentRoot&quot;
&gt;&gt;  override=&quot;org.eclipse.jdt.renameProcessor.IResource&quot;
    class=&quot;org.eclipse.jdt.internal.corext.refactoring.rename.RenameSourceFolderProcessor&quot;&gt;
    &lt;enablement&gt;
      &lt;or&gt;
        &lt;instanceof value=&quot;org.eclipse.jdt.core.IPackageFragmentRoot&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;and&gt;
            &lt;instanceof value=&quot;org.eclipse.core.resources.IFolder&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;property name=&quot;org.eclipse.jdt.core.isSourceFolder&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/and&gt;
      &lt;/or&gt;
    &lt;/enablement&gt;     
&lt;/renameProcessor&gt;</pre></blockquote>
<p>With the override attribute (marked with &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;&quot;
in the above example) the rename package fragment root processor
specifies that it replaces the rename resource processor if its object
state matches. This is the case if the element to be renamed is of
instance IPackageFragmenRoot (which is the case if a source folder is
selected in the package explorer) or if the element is of instance
IFolder and it can be converted into a source folder (which is the case
if a source folder is selected in the resource navigator).</p>
<p>What happens if the processor isn't unique for an element? In this
case the user has to decide which processor he wants to use to perform
the refactoring. Analogous to the Open With menu item the user is able
to define a preferred processor to avoid unnecessary user arbitration.</p>



<h3>Sharable participants</h3>
<p>When refactoring more than one element, for example moving two HTML
files from one folder to another, there could be one participant
instance handling both file or two participant instances each handling
one file. Since it can't be defined up-front what the best solution is, a
participant can be tagged as sharable. If it is tagged so, it will be
reused for all elements which match the same extension as the sharable
participant.</p>
<h3>Sharable Precondition checking</h3>
<p>Preconditions like validateEdit must be check together for the processor and all participants (otherwise the user would see multiple dialogs). Participants can therefore contribute to shared precondition checkers instead of implementing the check by themselves.</p>
