<h4>Sharing peferrence settings<br>
</h4>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Problem:</span> Settings on a
preference pages can depend on settings on other pages. Some settings
are even shared. We are currently forced to keep this kind of settings
on the same page.<br>
In the current implementation of the preference page, each page keeps
the actual value of a setting in its own temporary store. This store is
not visible to other pages. The user can switch between pages and make
changes to them, but only when 'apply' is pressed the pages apply their
changes to the preference store where they become 'common' knowledge.<br>
<br>
Existing problem scenarios:<br>
<ol>
  <li>The webapp build path depends on the Java build path <a href="#1">*:</a><br>
The Java build path is configured in the project properties. The webapp
plugin has its own page that also works on the build path. Changes in
the webapp pages should be visible in the Java build path page and vice
versa. Have a look at bug <a
 href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=32378">32378</a>
which contains the discussion we had with the IBM guys about that. <br>
In the Eclipse's extension point philisophy 'add, don't replace', we
can't filter away the Java build path, so the actual settings must be
shared.<br>
Our implementation now forces an apply when the page looses the focus.
It is a bit of an effort to implement and also not perfect due to bug <a
 href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=52368">52368</a>.</li>
  <li>Java class path variables are also configured by PDE <a href="#2">**:</a><br>
The Java class path variable page shows all classpath variable and
their current values. PDE configures some of the variables depending on
the settings of its source locations page. When you change settings on
both pages and press then 'OK', you can get random results. The page
wins that is applied last (by the preference page container).</li>
  <li>Preview of syntax coloring also shows other configured
settings, e.g. font, editor background, configured on another page.<br>
This is definitely a detail, but it is less irritating if the settings
used in this preview correspond to what you just changed on the other
page</li>
</ol>
<a name="1"></a>* I am here considering property pages and preference
pages as similar as I
assume with the new project scope capabilities these two concepts will
come closer.<br>
<a name="2"></a>** classpath variables are currently accessed through a
Java-Core API which stores them in the preference store.<br>
<br>
My conclusion is: Private temporary stores that is
not accessible to others pages is a big problem<br>
We have to either force an 'apply' when a page is left, or we introduce
a common store where pages can communicate.<br>
<br>
More motivational points:<br>
<ol>
  <li>With the effort of finding a better structure of preference
pages, I could imagine to allow settings to be available on
more than one page: e.g. CVS decorators font selection could be at the
CVS page
but also be found on the 'font and color' preference page. Obviously
the two pages must be in sync and can not have two different states of
the settings at the same time</li>
  <li>One approach to better structure preference options is to
introduce
links on pages to quickly navigate to related settings. That means
information is coming closer together, more linked</li>
  <li>Inspired by Tod's prototype (nr 3), I think we should try to
break up some of the currently huge pages in smaller parts. That,
however, will add more pressure on options interfering with each other
e.g. when having a shared preview.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Solution:</span><br>
Two approaches:<br>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
  <li>The setting of every page are automatically applied when the page
is left. The user could be prompted or it is just done automatically. <br>
+ easy to implement, no problems with existing pages, no changes needed
for existing pages<br>
- New use model, dialogs could be disruptive.<br>
- Need a solution for the 'needs rebuild' problem and similar other
changes that result in bigger updates.<br>
- Pages still need an internal model until applied<br>
- Still only one page visible at a time as page.setVisible is used to
apply changes<br>
- Not possible to experiment with combination of settings if these
settings are on multiple pages (as leaving a page requires to save the
change) (-&gt; could be solved with a (new) global revert button)<br>
  </li>
  <li>The preference pages work on a copy of the preference settings (a
'working copy'). Pages can use this model directly and don't need to
keep an internal model. The per page 'apply' button would go away<br>
+ No triggering of updates until the preference page is ok'ed.
Implementations of pages get simpler as they can use the working copy
settings directly<br>
+ Would allow showing multiple pages at once (-&gt; Tod's prototype)<br>
- New use model<br>
- Pages need to be rewritten, need compatibility mode for old pages:
Settings applied directly to the preferences must be also reapplied to
the working copy, can result in conflicts (should not happen as each
setting should be configured only by one page)<br>
  </li>
</ol>
First implementation thoughts:<br>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
  <li>preference container calls 'page.okPressed' when before a page
becomes invisible. To offer a dialog ''You have unsaved changes, apply
now?', an additional API 'hasChanges()' is needed on the page<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<br>
Related issues:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Negotiation of settings (shared validation). A page that relies
on settings of an other page might have to veto a certain setting, e.g.
a web project requires a certain build path entry to be present (jar,
container, ect.)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Batching of preference change events: preference change events
are currently sent out one by one, resulting in multiple updates. Idea:
new listener to register, that is is able to report more than one
change at once</li>
  <li>Mechanism to share a required full build or other long running
operations (currently solved with jobs of same family: second job start
tests for other jobs of same family and will ask if job should be
restarted)</li>
</ol>
