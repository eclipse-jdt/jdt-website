<h1>Preference page usability</h1>
Nov. 5th, 2004 Martin Aeschlimann, Tom Eicher<br>
<br>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
  <li>User doesn't find settings</li>
  <li>User doesn't know of settings<br>
  </li>
  <ol>
  </ol>
  <li>Configuration of a feature is spread out on several pages<br>
  </li>
  <li>Settings are not directly accessible from where they apply<br>
  </li>
  <li>The number of settings is overwhelming</li>
  <li>Some pages have become very big (lots of tabs)</li>
  <li>Gap between preference page / property page<br>
  </li>
</ol>
The solution to find must be aware of the following realities:<br>
<ul>
  <li>We can't start from scratch. Backward compatibility must be
guaranteed. There will always be pages contributed by old plugins.
Existing products might not have the time to invest to completely
rewrite or restructure their pages. They must be shown as they are,
existing API must work&lt;&gt;</li>
  <li>&lt;&gt;We want users to experience Eclipse a single integrated
environment and might want to hide the component structure (plugins) in
which Eclipse is build.structured. But: achieving that requires a lot
of effort: Cross-component work is far more difficult and time
consuming that single component work. <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
Examples of spreaded preferences:<br>
<br>
<h3>CVS label decorators</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Enabling/Disabling label decorators is on Workbench -&gt; Label
Declarators<br>
    <img alt="General Label Decorator page" src="label-dec1.png"
 style="width: 296px; height: 125px;"></li>
  <li>Actual configuration is on the CVS label decorator page<br>
    <img alt="CVS label decorator page" src="label-dec2.png"
 style="width: 500px; height: 360px;"></li>
  <li>Color and Font decoration is on the Color &amp; Fonts page<br>
    <img alt="Color &amp; Fonts preference page" src="label-dec3.png"
 style="width: 434px; height: 184px;"><br>
  </li>
</ul>
The reasons for the current situation are the following:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Label decorators are contributed to platform.ui. platform.ui
decides which decorators to enable/disable and therefore hosts the the
label decorator page. The page has the advantage to give an overview of
showing all label decorators but isn't helpful in saying what such a
decoration means<br>
  </li>
  <li>All settings for the CVS decorator are CVS specific. Having them
in the CVS category makes sense. The problem is that enablement is on
another page</li>
  <li>CVS color/font decorations are on the Color/Font page. CVS wants
to be a good citizen and uses the existing infrastructure. The
advantage is that having that the user can configure the whole color
setup at one place, with the (future) possibility to save a color
scheme. The disadvantage is that now the CVS decorator page isn't
complete: It shows the color in it's preview, but doesn't allow to
configure it.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Java editor appearance</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Editor font is on the color and font page<br>
    <img alt="Color &amp; Fonts page" src="editor-color-fonts1.png"
 style="width: 455px; height: 181px;"></li>
  <li>Font styles and color for syntax highlighting are on a Java
editor sub page<br>
    <img alt="Syntax hightlighting" src="editor-color-fonts2.png"
 style="width: 499px; height: 352px;"><br>
  </li>
  <li>Colors of annotations in the text are on the Text editor<br>
    <img alt="Text editor page" src="editor-color-fonts3.png"
 style="width: 427px; height: 227px;"></li>
&lt;&gt;More colors on the Java editor appearance page<br>
  <img alt="Java Editor appearance page" src="editor-color-fonts4.png"
 style="width: 502px; height: 164px;"><br>
  <br>
</ul>
The reasons for the current situation are the following:<br>
<ul>
  <li>The color &amp; fonts page has proved to be too general for the
editor settings. In the editor there's only one font but many colors
and styles.</li>
  <li>Some of the constructs that have colors (e.g. Annotations) have
additional settings associated with them: 'Highlight in text'. Breaking
that up for the reason of being a good Color &amp; Font page citizen is
also not optimal</li>
  <li>Annotations are configured for all editors and therefor not on
the Java editor page<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Suggested improvements<br>
</h2>
We think that if we the following action points and ideas will lead to
better usability:<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Introduce links in preference
pages</span>: Place links on preference pages to navigate to related or
more general settings.<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Don't force a setting to be only
on one page</span>: For example: contribute a color &amp; fonts but
still have a color configuration box on the syntax highlighting page.
The settings are of course in sync</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Don't force the preference tree
to be complete</span>: Some pages should be allowed to be only be
reachable through links or when opened externally: <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Hide advanced settings</span>: Certain
settings are very technical (various buffer sizes) and should be on
advanced pages. </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">View preferences</span>: No view
settings in the global preferences anymore. The view menu should have a
'Preferences...' menu entry<br>
    <img alt="View preferences menu point" src="view-preferences.png"
 style="width: 386px; height: 150px;"><br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Add a new Filter/Serch field</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
  </li>
</ul>
