<p>There are different possibilities to solve this problem:</p>
<ul>
	<li>the platform supports workspace checkpoint and rollback (see <a
		href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=36958">bug 36958</a>).
	Then refactoring marks the current configuration as a checkpoint before
	performing the changes. Undo is then simply a rollback.</li>
	<li>the workbench provides one logical undo stack. This can either be
	one global stack or separate stacks. If separate stacks are used global
	undo objects are pushed on all stacks. Furthermore all modifying
	operations must provide a corresponding undo operation. Before a
	refactoring operation can be undone all previous operations must be
	undone.</li>
	<li>the refactoring change objects register themselves as change
	listeners with their corresponding delta provider. For example resource
	change objects register themselves as resource change listeners, Java
	change objects register themselves as Java change listeners, etc.
	Depending on the delta they enable or disable themselves. Before a undo
	operation is performed the manager checks if all undo objects are still
	enabled. Since this solution leads to a high number of change listeners
	(there can be hundreds of change objects) we dismissed it when
	implementing the current refactoring infrastructure. It noticably slows
	down change notification.</li>
	<li>before a refactoring is undone the manager asked all change objects
	if they are still valid. We dismissed this solution as well since an
	undo change object can depend on the result of a previous undo object.
	Consider the following case with two change objects: change one
	modifies file A.java, change two deletes it. Asking the corresponding
	undo changes in isolation if they can be undone answers no since file
	A.java doesn't exist anymore. Undo change one relies on the fact that
	undo change two restores file A.java.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore an open refactoring architecture needs some enhanced undo
support from the platform.</p>
