<h2 align="center">Participating in Refactorings</h2>


This proposal outlines how other plug-ins can participate in certain
refactoring operations like rename, move, delete, etc. Interested
parties should review this document and verify that their use cases are
addressed in the requirements and that the proposed solution satisfies
their needs. Feedback is strongly encouraged and may be provided on the
jdt-ui-dev mailing list or in the
<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37937">bug report
37937</a>
for this plan item.
<blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Support Java references outside Java code</b>.
References to Java elements in particular classes can show up in
specific kinds of non-Java source files, such as plug-in manifest files
(plugin.xml), extension point schema files, and Java launch
configurations in the workspace. These references should also <b>participate</b>
in Java operations like search, <b>move</b>, <b>rename</b>, and <b>other
refactoring</b> operations. JDT will surface APIs that enable other

<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>The current refactoring implementation has the following three
shortcomings:</p>
<ol>
	<li>refactoring support is limited to Java resources. As a result all
	current refactorings don't update references to Java elements contained
	in non-Java files. It is desirable for example that renaming a class
	also updates launch configurations and plugin.xml files. Or that
	renaming a method updates references in JSP files. Additionally tools
	that deal with logical resources (resources consisting of a couple of
	physical resources) want to keep the logical resource consistent if a
	physical resource gets changed. For example a EJB maps to three
	different Java files: bean.java, beanr.java, beanlocal.java. Changing
	the name of bean.java should update beanr.java and beanlocal.java as
	well.</li>
	<li>the implementation is internal to JDT/UI packages and not exposed
	as API. Other plug-ins can neither add new Java refactorings nor can
	they reuse the refactoring infrastructure to code refactorings for
	other programming languages.</li>
	<li>Refactoring based actions are only available in JDT/UI views and
	editors. For example, triggering a rename on a *.java file which is on
	the build path of a Java project doesn't activate a rename compilation
	unit refactoring in the resource navigator. Instead the user gets a
	normal resource rename dialog.</li>
</ol>
<p>This document focusses on items 1 and 3.</p>
<h3>The Current Implementation</h3>
<p>Although refactoring is located in the JDT/UI plug-in it is already
separated into a UI and a core layer:</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Core</i>: the main core abstractions are <code>Refactoring</code>
	and <code>IChange</code>. A concrete refactoring (e.g a subclass of
	class Refactoring) is responsible for precondition checking and change
	creation (e.g returning an instance of class IChange). The precondition
	checking is split into two phases:</li>
	<ol>
		<li><i>activation checking</i>: this is a &quot;fast&quot; check (no
		progress reporting) used to find out if the refactoring can be
		executed in general. It is called when a refactoring action is
		triggered, but before the refactoring UI is presented. If it returns a
		fatal error then the refactoring UI isn't presented at all.</li>
		<li><i>user input checking</i>: this is an exhaustive check (with
		progress reporting) based on the refactoring itself and the user
		input. It is performed when the user presses the OK or Preview button
		on the refactoring UI.</li>
	</ol>
	When executing a refactoring head-less both checks are combined into
	one single precondition checking method. An IChange object is
	responsible for performing the actual source manipulations. It is also
	responsible to produce an undo object.
	<li><i>UI</i><b>: </b>the refactoring UI is wizard based and consists
	of 1 .. n input pages, a page presenting errors resulting from
	precondition checking and a page that shows a preview of the
	refactoring changes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Proposal</h3>
<p>To enable other plug-ins to participate in certain refactorings their
implementations are split into a processor/participant architecture. An
extensible refactoring has one processor and 0 .. n participants. The
major characteristics of processors and participants are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b><i>Processor</i></b>: the main actor of a refactoring. It can
	exist without any participants. A processor is almost identical to a
	current refactoring and is determined based on the element to be
	refactored.</li>
	<li><b><i>Participant</i></b>: participates in a refactoring. A
	participant can't exist without a processor and is determined based on
	the element to be refactored. A participant can participate in
	precondition checking and change creation. There is no support for
	participants to provide additional UI. A typical participant, provided
	by a JSP/Web plug-in, is a rename method participant. The participant
	updates references to the method to be renamed in JSP files. This
	includes both updating references in embedded Java code as well as
	updating references in tags (e.g. usebean tag, etc.).
	<p>Participants can only participate in changes triggered by a
	processor. There is no support to participate in changes caused by
	another participant. The processor/participant architecture will not
	support arbitrary refactoring composition. Refactoring composition
	requires that a precondition check describes its result in some kind of
	postcondition which is then used as input for precondition checking of
	the next sibling refactoring in the composite. Consider the following
	example: a composite refactoring consists of the two refactorings (a)
	create class A.java and (b) add a method to A.java. One precondition
	check of refactoring (b) is: does A.java exist? Therefore evaluating
	the preconditions of both refactorings in isolation will fail. In
	contrast precondition checking in the processor/participant
	architecture assumes that the changes performed by the processor and
	the participants are &quot;unrelated&quot; to each other and therefore
	the preconditions can be checked in isolation.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>Both processors and participants are contributed via extension
points. XML expressions (comparable to those used for contributing to a
pop-up menu) are used to describe their availability.</p>
<p>For each refactoring that is split into a processor/participant there
is a &quot;generic&quot; action. This action creates a generic
refactoring responsible to find the right processor and participants
depending on the element(s) selected. Having such a generic action
ensures that the same refactoring is triggered independent from where
the refactoring is activated. The UI for the refactoring is determined
by the processor chosen to process the element. Since processors and
participants create errors and change objects typically not known by the
refactoring framework the error and preview page must be extensible as
well. The concrete status error viewer is picked depending on the type
of status returned from precondition checking. The type of the change
objects determines the concrete preview viewer. Additionally special
content providers are needed for different change types to ensure proper
rendering the of tree presenting all changes.</p>
<p>The picture below presents an overview of the new
processor/participant split. Classes labeled as &quot;generic&quot; are
provided by the refactoring framework. Classes labeled as
&quot;concrete&quot; are concrete implementations provided by clients. A
dashed line expresses a references between classes configurable via
extension points. Solid lines indicate a fixed reference not
configurable by client plug-ins.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="Diagramm.gif"></p>
<p>The details of the processor/participant architecture are illustrated
by examples. Please note that JDT/UI is the home of the current
implementation. Hence all extension points are prefixed with
org.eclipse.jdt.ui. This will change when the code is moved into a
separate plug-in.</p>
<h4>Renaming a Java method</h4>
<p>Renaming method A#foo() into A#bar() takes place according to the
following steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>The generic rename refactoring searches in Eclipse's registry for a
	processor that is able to &quot;rename&quot; a Java method. An example
	of a processor capable to rename a Java method is:</p>
	<pre>&lt;renameProcessor
    id=&quot;org.eclipse.jdt.renameProcessor.Method&quot;
    class=&quot;org.eclipse.jdt.internal.corext.refactoring.rename.RenameMethodProcessor&quot;&gt;
    &lt;objectState&gt;
	&lt;property name=&quot;instanceof&quot; value=&quot;org.eclipse.jdt.core.IMethod&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/objectState&gt;
&lt;/renameProcessor&gt;</pre>
	<p>Due to its extensibility the new generic rename refactoring can only
	assume that it is renaming an element of type object. Hence a Java
	method rename processor must constrain its availability to IMethods.
	The &lt;objectState&gt; element can be used to describe a processor's
	availability depending on the state of the element to be renamed.
	Section <a href="#property_evaluation">Property Evaluation in
	Plugin.xml Files</a> provides an overview of the property evaluation
	mechanism used by the refactoring plug-in.</p>
	<p>The rename action is disabled if no processor can be found.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Find all interested participants of a Java method rename. A typical
	rename Java method participant looks as follows:</p>
	<pre>&lt;renameParticipant
    class=&quot;org.example.jsp.refactoring.RenameMethodParticipant&quot;
    id=&quot;org.example.jsp.refactoring.renameMethodParticipant&quot;&gt;
    &lt;projectScope&gt;
        &lt;property name=&quot;nature&quot; value=&quot;org.example.jsp.core.jspnature&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/projectScope&gt;
    &lt;objectState&gt;
        &lt;property name=&quot;instanceof&quot; value=&quot;org.eclipse.jdt.core.IMethod&quot;/&gt;
	&lt;property name=&quot;isPrivate&quot; value=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/objectState&gt;
&lt;/renameParticipant&gt;	</pre>
	<p>Since participants are typically defined in higher level pug-ins
	care must be taken to avoid unnecessary plug-in loading. This is
	achieved by a two step approach:
	<ol>
		<li>the refactoring processor is responsible to compute a set of
		affected projects, called the project scope of the refactoring. E.g.
		when renaming a Java method these are all projects which directly or
		indirectly reference the project in which the method to be renamed is
		declared. Refactoring processors for other languages might use a
		different algorithm to compute the set of affected projects. A
		refactoring participant must provide a &lt;projectScope&gt; element.
		The participant gets only loaded, if at least one project of the
		project scope set matches the expression in the &lt;projectScope&gt;
		element. In the example above this means the JSP rename method
		participant gets only loaded iff one of the affected projects has a
		JSP nature. This ensures that the JSP participant gets only loaded if
		the user does JSP development.</li>
		<li>Besides the project scope a refactoring participant has to provide
		an &lt;objectState&gt; element to express for which objects it is
		applicable. In the example above the rename method participant in the
		JSP world is applicable to IMethods. Furthermore it requires that the
		method isn't private (since private methods can't be referenced
		outside its declaring type renaming them can't affect any JSP files).</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Both projectScope and objectState are mandatory.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Compute the activation status of the rename refactoring by
	considering activation status of the processor and all participants. If
	the returned status doesn't contain any fatal error, determine the UI
	depending on the state of the processor. Processors are UI independent
	hence they can't have any references to the UI. So the processor UI
	relationship must be defined somewhere else. This is done by describing
	the relationship in XML as well.
	<pre>
&lt;refactoringWizard
    id=&quot;org.eclipse.jdt.renameProcessor.ui.IMethod&quot;
    class=&quot;org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.refactoring.reorg.RenameMethodWizard&quot;&gt;
    &lt;objectState&gt;
        &lt;property name=&quot;instanceof&quot; value=&quot;org.eclipse.jdt.internal.corext.refactoring.rename.RenameMethodProcessor&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/objectState&gt;
&lt;/refactoringWizard&gt;</pre></li>
	<li>When the user presses the OK or Preview button the processor
	forwards the collected input (e.g new name, etc.) to all participants.
	Next user input checking is performed considering the rename processor
	and all loaded participants. Depending on the outcome of this check,
	the refactoring is executed by computing a composite change containing
	the changes from the processor and the participants.</li>
	<li>Picking the right error and preview viewer happens analogous to
	other viewer selection in Eclipse.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Derived Elements</h4>
<p>The concept of derived elements is discussed using the rename Java
field refactoring. Fields are commonly used as properties with
corresponding setter and getter methods. A special rename field
refactoring is aware of this relationship and renames the setter and
getter method when the field gets renamed. Participants are contributed
based on the element to be changed. Since the main element is a field no
rename method participants are loaded. Therefore a processor can provide
a set of additional elements that it manipulates. These elements are
called derived elements. In contrast to participants that work on the
main element (in our example the Java field), derived participants may
depend on user input. E.g. in JDT renaming the corresponding setter and
getter of a field can be controlled by the user. So derived participants
can only be loaded after the user has pressed the finish or preview
button. Since they missed the check activation phase of the precondition
checking the result of the activation check of derived participants is
merged into the result of the processor's input checking.</p>

<h4>Resource Modifications</h4>
<p>The concept of resource modifications is discussed using the rename
Java package refactoring. Although packages are mapped to folders on the
file system, renaming a package is a different operation than renaming
its underlying folder. Renaming a package maps to the following resource
operations:</p>
<ol>
	<li>create a folder with the new name, if such a folder doesn't exist
	yet.</li>
	<li>move all files from the underlying folder to the new folder created
	in step 1.</li>
	<li>delete the underlying folder if it is empty.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now consider the following example: package p1 contains Java and HTML
files. Additionally, there is a HTML plug-in that wants to participate
in moving HTML files to update href elements in other HTML files. Since
a HTML plug-in doesn't know anything about Java it can't participate in
renaming a package. Even if it had a reference to the Java plug-in,
participating in a package rename to determine this situation would
require that the HTML plug-in doubles the logic for mapping a package
rename to the underlying file system. To solve this problem a
refactoring processor must express higher level operations in terms of
resource modifications when possible. These resource modifications are
then taken to determine the appropriate set of participants. This means
for the HTML plug-in that it is enough to register a file move
participant. Like participants for derived elements participants for
resource modifications are computed after user input. Hence their
activation checking is merged into the processors input checking as
well.</p>
<h4>Specializing Processors</h4>
<p>Source folders (package fragment roots) are a special kind of
folders. Besides their underlying folder on disk additional information
about the build path and the output folder is associated with a source
folder. Will there be a special rename source folder processor or a
folder rename participant? The Java model offers a method to rename a
source folder which updates the necessary build path information.
Therefore implementing s source folder rename with a participant
duplicates that code in a participant. Furthermore the provided delta
looks different. A participant implementation triggers the following
deltas:</p>
<ul>
	<li>a resource delta notifying about the folder rename.</li>
	<li>a Java model delta notifying about the build path changes.</li>
	<li>a Java model delta notifying about the source folder rename without
	build path updates. This delta occurs since the Java model listens to
	resource deltas and tries to map them back to Java model deltas.</li>
</ul>
<p>A special source folder processor triggers the following deltas:</p>
<ul>
	<li>a Java model delta notifying about the source folder rename and the
	build path update.</li>
	<li>a resource delete notifying the folder rename.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly the second delta is more appropriate. It is exactly what
clients listening to deltas expect. Therefore the source folder rename
is implemented using a special processor. For the given example the two
processors are defined as follows:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#### The processor to rename resource (files, folders, projects, ....)
&lt;renameProcessor
    id=&quot;org.eclipse.jdt.renameProcessor.IResource&quot;
    class=&quot;org.eclipse.jdt.internal.corext.refactoring.rename.RenameResourceProcessor&quot;&gt;
    &lt;objectState&gt;
        &lt;property name=&quot;instanceof&quot; value=&quot;org.eclipse.core.resources.IResource&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/objectState&gt;
&lt;/renameProcessor&gt;

#### The processor to rename source folders
&lt;renameProcessor
    id=&quot;org.eclipse.jdt.renameProcessor.IPackageFragmentRoot&quot;
&gt;&gt;  override=&quot;org.eclipse.jdt.renameProcessor.IResource&quot;
    class=&quot;org.eclipse.jdt.internal.corext.refactoring.rename.RenameSourceFolderProcessor&quot;&gt;
    &lt;objectState&gt;
      &lt;or&gt;
        &lt;property name=&quot;instanceof&quot; value=&quot;org.eclipse.jdt.core.IPackageFragmentRoot&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;and&gt;
            &lt;property name=&quot;instanceof&quot; value=&quot;org.eclipse.core.resources.IFolder&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;property name=&quot;isSourceFolder&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/and&gt;
      &lt;/or&gt;
    &lt;/objectState&gt;     
&lt;/renameProcessor&gt;</pre></blockquote>
<p>With the override attribute (marked with &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;&quot;
in the above example) the rename package fragment root processor
specifies that it replaces the rename resource processor if its object
state matches. This is the case if the element to be renamed is of
instance IPackageFragmenRoot (which is the case if a source folder is
selected in the package explorer) or if the element is of instance
IFolder and it can be converted into a source folder (which is the case
if a source folder is selected in the resource navigator).</p>
<p>What happens if the processor isn't unique for an element? In this
case the user has to decide which processor he wants to use to perform
the refactoring. Analogous to the Open With menu item the user is able
to define a preferred processor to avoid unnecessary user arbitration.</p>
<h3><a name="property_evaluation">Property Evaluation in Plugin.xml
Files</a></h3>
<p>To avoid unnecessary plug-in activation processor and participant
contributions need means to describe there availability. The current
implementation uses an extensible property evaluation mechanism to do
so. I implemented a new mechanism instead of using the existing
IActionFilter mechanism due to the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
	<li>IActionFilter is part of Platform/UI, but processors and
	participants are UI independent functionality.</li>
	<li>IActionFilters are registered with the adaptable mechanism. Hence
	there can only be one action filter per type. E.g. there can't be two
	property testers for ICompilationUnit contributed by different
	plug-ins.</li>
	<li>IActionFilter interprets the case that a property can't be
	evaluated because the plug-in providing the tester isn't loaded yet as
	true. This can result in unneeded plug-in activation. The new
	implementation uses the three values: FALSE, TRUE, NOT_LOADED. Testing
	for an unknown property results in a core exception since it is a
	programming error.</li>
	<li>Action enablement in the UI supports the notion of
	&quot;adaptable&quot;. If requested, the workbench adapts the element
	to be checked to <code>IContributorResourceAdapter</code>. In an open
	refactoring architecture the class to which the element is to be
	adapted must be configurable. The new property implementation supports
	such a mechanism in the form of &lt;objectState
	adaptable=&quot;classname&quot;&gt;. The key passed to
	IAdaptable.getAdapter must be an object of type <code>Class</code>, not
	a string. Therefore the class name must be converted into a <code>Class</code>
	object, which can lead to plug-in class loading. The class loader of
	the plug-in containing the &lt;objecState adaptable=&quot;...&quot;&gt;
	element is used to convert the class name into a <code>Class</code>.
	Therefore only required plug-ins might be loaded by this mechanism (no
	upcalls). Additionally, availability checks take place on user actions,
	hence no unnecessary plug-in loading takes place on start-up.</li>
</ul>
<p>Defining a new property tester is done in XML in the following way:</p>
<blockquote><pre>&lt;extension point=&quot;org.eclipse.jdt.ui.propertyTesters&quot;&gt;
    &lt;propertyTester
        id=&quot;IResourcePropertyTester
        type=&quot;org.eclipse.core.resources.IResource&quot;
        properties=&quot;name, projectNature&quot;
        class=&quot;org.eclipse.jdt.internal.corext.refactoring.participants.xml.ResourcePropertyTester&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/extension&gt;</pre></blockquote>
<p>The attributes do have the following meaning:</p>
<ul>
	<li>id: a unique id</li>
	<li>type: the type the property tester is working on</li>
	<li>properties: the properties the tester can handle. Enumerating the
	properties in XML ensure that a property tester only gets loaded iff it
	can handle the property.</li>
	<li>class: the class implementing the property tester.</li>
</ul>

<p>To ensure optimal performance for instance of checks (they are the
most used property tests), the &quot;instanceof&quot; property is
pre-defined and not contributed.</p>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>A first implementation of the proposed processor/participant
architecture exists in the JDT/UI plugin. The relevant packages are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>org.eclipse.jdt.internal.corext.refactoring.participants: defines
	the protocol processor and participants must conform to. The most
	relevant interfaces are: IRefactoringProcessor and
	IRefactoringParticipant. The package also contains processor and
	participant definitions for rename, move, delete, etc.</li>
	<li>org.eclipse.jdt.internal.corext.refactoring.participants.xml:
	contains the extensible property tester mechanism.</li>
	<li>org.eclipse.jdt.internal.corext.refactoring.rename: contains
	concrete rename processors for Java elements.</li>
	<li>org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.refactoring: contains the refactoring
	UI with support for pluggable status and preview viewers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The plugin org.eclipse.jdt.ui.examples.javafamily contains a rename
type participant to update type references in JSPs.</p>
<p>As always you understand ideas better after you have written them
down. Therefore the proposal contains some concepts not yet implemented
or implemented in a different way.</p>
<h3>Open Issues</h3>
<p>The refactoring undo implementation has several shortcomings. The
shortcomings mainly originate from the fact that refactoring was written
for Java files only. The undo manager makes the following assumptions:</p>
<ul>
	<li>before a refactoring is executed all dirty files (opened in an
	editor) are saved. This is necessary to have a &quot;sync&quot; point
	between the editor's local undo stack and the refactoring undo stack.
	Before a refactoring is undone the manager checks if there are dirty
	files affected by the undo operation. If this is the case then undo
	can't be performed.</li>
	<li>the undo manager flushes the undo stack as soon as a Java resource
	gets modified (it listens to Java model deltas). In an open refactoring
	architecture this can't be sustained. Arbitrary resources can be
	modified.
	We have evaluated two approaches to solve this problem locally in the refactoring framework. But as outlined both approaches have been dismissed:<ul>
		<li>the refactoring change objects register themselves as change
		listeners with their corresponding delta provider. For example
		resource change objects register themselves as resource change
		listeners, Java change objects register themselves as Java change
		listeners, etc. Depending on the delta they enable or disable
		themselves. Before an undo operation is performed the manager checks if
		all undo objects are still enabled. Since this solution leads to a
		high number of change listeners (there can be hundreds of change
		objects) we dismissed it when implementing the current refactoring
		infrastructure. It noticably slows down change notification.</li>
		<li>before a refactoring is undone the manager asked all change
		objects if they are still valid. We dismissed this solution as well
		since an undo change object can depend on the result of a previous
		undo object. Consider the following case with two change objects:
		change one modifies file A.java, change two deletes it. Asking the
		corresponding undo changes in isolation if they can be undone answers
		no since file A.java doesn't exist anymore. Undo change one relies on
		the fact that undo change two restores file A.java.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>The platform is working on a new context concept to limit the number
of available actions. We should check if the &lt;projectState&gt;
element for participants can leverage the new context concept.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>

<ul>
	<li>There is one generic action for refactorings like rename, move,
	delete, etc.</li>
	<li>Extensible refactorings are implemented using a
	processor/participant architecture. Both processors and participants
	are contributed via XML.</li>
	<li>There are three types of participants:
	<ol>
		<li>participants that operate on the original element to be modified.</li>
		<li>participants that operate on elements derived from the original
		element.</li>
		<li>participants that operate on the corresponding resource
		modifications.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Participants can't contribute to the UI, although this would be
	possible for participants of category (1) if required.</li>
	<li>There is no support to participate in changes done by a
	participant. Participants can only participate in processor operations.</li>
	<li>No support will be provided for composite refactorings.</li>
	<li>Processors can override each other to provide a more specific
	processor for more specific elements.</li>
	<li>The new refactoring UI is wizard/dialog based as the current Java
	refactoring UI. The relationship between UI and processors is described
	in XML. Furthermore special error and preview viewers can be
	contributed.</li>
	<li>To support undo in an open refactoring architecture some enhanced
	undo support from platform is needed.</li>
