- TO DO JUST AFTER 2.1
	- integrate CHKPII into our build process
	- review existing/new tools - decide to drop or improve them e.g. the html editor tool

- Tools
	- update existing tools which have been used before to run on the newest builds early enough

- Javadoc
	- spelling
		(tool opportunity)
	- grammar
	- completeness
	- @since tags
	- correctness
		- return value (can null be returned?)
		- parameter list (can null be passed as parameter?)
		- exceptions
	- package.html files
		-copyright/licence
		
- copyright/license
	- every file NOTE: this includes the schema files (.exsd)
	- list of contributors
	- it is not good enough to change the referenced image because of the alt attribute
		
- checking NLS
 - no not-externalized strings (we have a tool)
 - no duplicated keys in .properties files (we have a tool)
 - no unused keys in .properties files (we have a tool)
 - no missing keys in .properties files (we have a tool)
 - no single quotes in .properties files 
    (we use CHKPII now, but it's not publicly available)

- properties files
	- spelling
		(tool: extract property file - see also bug 35036 - the current tool only collects the property files into one file and removes the '&' and keys)
	- grammar
	- style (in particular error messages)
		see: Jeff Johnson GUI Bloopers
	- capitalization
		booktitle capitalization vs. sentence capitalization
	
- help context ids
	- completeness
	- cross checking with the xml files (we have a tool)
	- all help context ids are defined as constants (we have a tool but this has bugs in this area)
		(including the ones define in XML)
	
- CVS file types checking
	- informing releng about exceptions (e.g. binary files)

- code
	- no System.out.println in source
	- no empty catch blocks (we have never done this)
	- no unused elements (imports, members, temps)
	- no use of deprecated APIs (where possible)
	- no use of internal APIs (where possible)
	- no mixed line delimiters (minor)
	
- UI
	- default values pass over preferences
	- artwork finish pass
	- mnemonics
	- accessibility (e.g. view toolbar actions)
	
- ISV doc
	- schema file completeness
	- if a plug-in contains schemas its plugin.xml must be listed in buildDoc.xml (see pde.convertSchemaToHTML)
	- each generated schema html file must be listed in topics_Reference.xml
	- if a structural change (e.g. source folder rename) takes place the *options and options.txt must be adapted
	- if a new API package has been added
		- it must be added to *options and *options.txt
		- its package-sumary.html must be listed in topics_Reference.html
	- examples up to date
	
- User doc
	- welcome page up to date
	- screenshots
	
- Overall (ISV doc, User doc, other files) - to just at the end
	- run tool (e.g. HTML Power Tools) which ensures ALT attribute is set
	- run tool (e.g. HTML Power Tools) which computes images size and correctly sets width and height attributes
	- run tool (e.g. HTML Power Tools) which checks spelling
	- run tool which checks that no links are broken (must be run against Linux or special web server to find capitalization bugs)
