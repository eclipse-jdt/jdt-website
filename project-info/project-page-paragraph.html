<p>The JDT project provides the tool plug-ins that implement a Java IDE 
        supporting the development of any Java application, including Eclipse 
        plug-ins. It adds a Java project nature and Java perspective to the Eclipse 
        Workbench as well as a number of views, editors, wizards, builders, and 
        code merging and refactoring tools. The JDT project allows Eclipse to 
        be a development environment for itself.<br>
