<td COLSPAN="2">The JDT-APT project provides plugins that add Java 5 annotation processing support to Eclipse.

A Java annotation processor is a compiler plug-in that can gather information about source code as 
it is being compiled, generate additional Java types or other resource files, and post warnings 
and errors. Eclipse 3.2 provided support for annotation processors using the 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/apt/mirror/overview-summary.html">Java 5 Mirror APIs</a>,
and Eclipse 3.3 added support for processors using the 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/annotation/processing/package-summary.html">
Java 6 annotation processing APIs</a>.</p>
<p>
You can view the presentation given at JavaOne 2005 during a session on APT that describes some of the goals
and technical details <a href="javaone_apt.ppt">here</a>. At EclipseCon 2006 we made a
<a href="Eclipsecon2006.ppt">presentation</a> on APT do's and don'ts, and at EclipseCon 2007 this was
developed into a <a href="eclipsecon2007.zip">tutorial</a> on writing annotation processors for Eclipse,
including some sample code and more discussion of techniques to achieve good performance. At EclipseCon 2008
we gave a <a href="eclipsecon2008.ppt">presentation</a> on annotations (which briefly mentions annotation
processors but does not go into depth) that may be of interest to those looking for background material
or for alternative strategies to annotation processing.

What is APT?</font></font></b></td>

<tr>
<td COLSPAN="2"><font color="#000000">APT stands for Annotation Processing Tool. 
Sun shipped an API for APT in JDK 1.5, which can be viewed at
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/apt/mirror/index.html">
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/apt/mirror/index.html</a>. Sun also included a commandline 
implementation of APT in JDK 1.5. You can find documentation for it at
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/apt/index.html" target="_blank">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/apt/index.html</a>.
In JDK 6, the API was modified considerably and standardized through JSR-269, and the Sun implementation was
built into the javac compiler rather than requiring a standalone tool.
<p>
To quote from Sun's documentation:
<p>
<code>
apt is a command-line utility for annotation processing.
It includes a set of reflective APIs and supporting infrastructure to
process program annotations (JSR 175).
These reflective APIs provide a build-time, source-based,
read-only view of program structure.  They are designed to cleanly model
the Java<sup><small>TM</small></sup>
programming language's type system after the addition of generics (JSR 14).
</code>

<p>
So, APT provides a means for generating files and compiling new java classes based on annotations
found in your source code.

<p>
JDT-APT is not based on Sun's implementation, but rather is a separate implementation of
the APT APIs that runs entirely within Eclipse.

<td COLSPAN="2"><font color="#000000">
<p>
If all you need to do is use an annotation processor, you may not need to do anything at all! Many project
creation wizards will automatically install and enable the necessary processors. To check whether this
is the case, or to install and enable your own processors, use the Java Compiler -&gt; Annotation Processing
pane of the project properties.
<p>
If you need to write your own annotation processor, see <a href="introToAPT.html">Intro to APT</a> to get 
started using APT, and also see the EclipseCon 2007 tutorial mentioned above.
