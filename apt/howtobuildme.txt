Eclipse APT Project - Developer Setup Instructions
==================================================

1.  Install Eclipse SDK 3.1.

2.  Launch eclipse, creating a new Workspace.  Say "C:\AptWorkspace". 

3.  Install a 1.5 JRE for eclipse.  To add it to Eclipse:

    a. go to "Window menu, and then choose "Preferences | Java | Installed JREs".
    b. click the add button and install the 1.5 JRE.  You will need to name this "JRE 1.5.0".
       Make this the default JRE.

4.  Now you need to check out the various CVS projects from the eclipse CVS server.

    a.  Configure your eclipse to point to the eclipse CVS repository:
        Open the "CVS Repository Exploring" Perspective. 
        Then right-click in the CVS Repositories frame and select New->Repository Location.
        Fill in the following values:
    
        Host:             dev.eclipse.org
        Repository path:  /home/eclipse
        User:             anonymous
        Password:         <leave blank>
        Connection type:   pserver         

    b.  Check out HEAD revisions of the following projects:
    
        org.eclipse.jdt.apt.core
        org.eclipse.jdt.apt.tests
        org.eclipse.jdt.apt.ui
        org.eclipse.test.performance
        
        To do this, open the :pserver:anonymous... node, and then 
        the HEAD node. Right-click on the folders as named above, and select
        "Check out". This will copy all the files to your local machine.

    c.  Refresh the branches.  Right-click the top-level "Branches" node 
        (adjacent to "HEAD"), and then select "Refresh Branches..."
        Select the following projects to be scanned for tags:

        org.eclipse.jdt.core
        org.eclipse.jdt.core.tests.builder
        org.eclipse.jdt.core.tests.compiler
        org.eclipse.jdt.core.tests.model
        org.eclipse.jdt.core.tests.performance

    d.  Check out APT branch revisions of the following projects :
        Under Branches, there will now be an "APT" branch. 
        Open that and select the following nodes:

        org.eclipse.jdt.core.tests.builder
        org.eclipse.jdt.core.tests.compiler
        org.eclipse.jdt.core.tests.model
        org.eclipse.jdt.core.tests.performance
        org.eclipse.jdt.core
        
        Then right-click each of them and select "Check out". This will take
        some time as all the files are copied to your local machine.
        
        You can now switch back to the "Java" Perspective.

5.  Copy the file tools.jar from the 1.5 JDK (%JDK_1.5_HOME%/lib/tools.jar) 
    into the root of the org.eclipse.jdt.apt.core project, 
    and then right-click that project and choose "Refresh". 

6.  Ensure that the workspace builds with no problems that are error level.
    You will see a few warnings depending on the strictness of your warning
    settins.

7.  If you want to export the plugin, then you can run the ant script at 
    org.eclipse.jdt.apt.core/scripts/exportplugin.xml
